Then we perform DFS on the nodes, stopping as soon as we detect a cycle. A list of prior nodes visited is passed down the function; the values contained therein are used to determine whether or not the current edge is part of a cycle. It then iterates through the edge list backwards to determine which connection is the last cyclic one which may be broken. This is then compared one at a time to the edge list entries in a backwards iteration order to find the last matching edge, and that edge is returned.\n",

It visits (up to) every node in the graph in iteration order ($n$ ops); once it discovers a cycle it visits (up to) every node in the graph again to reconstruct the cycle edge list ($n$ ops); then it compares that against the defining edgelist ($n$ ops again). $O(n + n + n) \\approx O(n)$.\n",
